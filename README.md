## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Boostrap 5.2
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

My major learnings while working through this project have been to create and offcanvas navigation for mobile view, and to work with nested grids on Bootstrap to have a column span more than one row.

### Useful resources

- [The Net Ninja - Bootstrap 5 Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_9u1P5YjVc&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9joIM91nLzd_qaH_AimmdAR) - This is a great 20 episode Boostrap 5 crash course. I'd recommend it to anyone starting with Bootstrap.
